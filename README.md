# World Leaders Classifier Project

## Description
This is a Machine Learning Classification project in which I trained an ML model using five world leaders.
The model identifies the leader's name when given an image of one of these five leaders. 
I also developed a web application that allows users to upload images and uses the model from the back end to identify the name and give a probability distribution.

## Features
- Classify world leaders based on uploaded images.
- Display probability scores for each leader.
- Informative error messages for image classification issues.

## Technologies Used
For the ML model:
- OpenCV
- Seaborn
- Python
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn

For the web development:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Dropzone.js (for file uploads)

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repo, and ```cd face-recognition```
2. ```cd server```
3. ``` python server.py```
4. Now open `index.html` file in your preferred browser and you can upload images.
